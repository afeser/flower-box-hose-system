## Special print settings

Detailed descriptions on how to adjust the print settings can be found [here](https://montebaur.tech/waterproof_3d-printing.html).

Summary: To make the components waterproof adjustments to the print setting are necessary (parameter names from Cura)
- Infill density: `100%`
- Wall thickness: 4 lines
- Flow (or extrusion multiplier): `108%`. Tells the printer to use more filament than necessary to close gaps between neighboring filament lines.
- Printing Temperature: `215Â°C`. A bit hotter than usual to make the filament flow better.
