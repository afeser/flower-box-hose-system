## Print Settings

Detailed descriptions on how to adjust the print settings can be found [here](https://montebaur.tech/projects/waterproof_3d-printing.html).

Summary: To make the components waterproof adjustments to the print setting are necessary (parameter names from Cura)
- Infill density: `100%`
- Wall thickness: 4 lines
- Flow (or extrusion multiplier): `108%`. Tells the printer to use more filament than necessary to close gaps between neighboring filament lines.
  - If your slicer is capable of setting different values for the flow used for the object and the support material, stick with 100% flow for the support material. Otherwise, removing the support will be more difficult.
- Printing Temperature: `215Â°C`. A bit hotter than usual to make the filament flow better.
- Try to orient the objects on the print bet such that the water flow direction is along the z axis ([explanation](https://montebaur.tech/projects/waterproof_3d-printing.html#object-orientation)).

## Changelog

### 2021-05-11:
- Added hose end cap.
- New wall connector that allows mounting a hose extender on a wall, e.g. of a plastic enclosure containing magnetic valves.
